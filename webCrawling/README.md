In this project, I worked with a simple web crawler to measure aspects of a crawl, study the
characteristics of the crawl, download web pages from the crawl and gather webpage metadata, all
from New York Daily News: http://www.nydailynews.com/

Using IntelliJ IDEA as IDE and crawler4j as web crawler.
